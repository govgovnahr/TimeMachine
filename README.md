How to make it work:

You will need to install ollama here: https://ollama.com/ .
Choose whichever model you would like.

Clone the repo to your machine. Navigate to `TimeMachine/server` and start the server: `python test.py`
resolve any missing libraries, you will likely need to install Flask `pip install flask` and Flask_CORS `pip install flask_cors`

Once the Flask server is up and running, navigate to `TimeMachine/client` and install the dependencies `npm i` . Now you can start the app with `npm start`! 

`ollama serve`

`python3 test.py`

`npm start`
